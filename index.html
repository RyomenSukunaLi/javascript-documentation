                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                            For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                            clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                            objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                            server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                            database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                            another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                            server.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                    to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="intro" id="helloWorld">
                <h2>Hello World</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
                    your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <p>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</p>
                    <p>greetMe("World");</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="intro" id="variables">
                <h2>Variables</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your applications. The names of variables called identifiers, conform to certain rules
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Javascript identifier must start with a letter, underscore(_) or dollar sign($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because Javascript letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 9959-1 or Unicode letters such as a and u in identifies. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifies. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
